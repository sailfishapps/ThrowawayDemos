This throwaway project demos an error generated when using the QtPositioning 5.2 PositionSource Element in QML

When the PostionSource start() method is called in QML, the following error is generated
QMetaMethod::invoke: Unable to handle unregistered datatype 'QGeoPositionInfo'

This project demos this error in 2 ways
a) with a standard import of "QtPositioning 5.2"

b) with equivalent code "in-line" called by importing "PositionSource 5.2"

Switching between these 2 imports is achieved by commenting in / out  the standard import and the "in-line" equivalent in FirstPage.qml

The idea of the "in-line" code is to allow tinkering and thus possibly to track down the source of the error (and suggest a solution).

Copyright of the inline src and headers files "pinched" from QtPositioning remains that of Diga, as stated at the top of the files. They are included here for demonstration purposes only.

Note this error is not generated on the Sailfish Emulator. It is generatd on a real Jolla running 1.0.2.5
